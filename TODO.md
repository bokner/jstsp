1. Test for reversing job list (model -> results -> feed schedule -> model)
2. Statement (Senne, Yanasse): given the job sequence, the lower bound for switches can be found with KTNS (Keep Tool Needed Soonest) algorithm (Tang, Denardo)
3. Add times to stats for finding optimal value and optimality proof
4. yuck + cplex for better upper bound
5. Dynamic MST for better upper bound
6. Channelling (sets + MIP)
7. Use lower bound algorithm (Yanasse/Senne) to a) improve lower bound, b) use initial sequence
