1. Model with sets
2. Zero-block constraints
3. Statement (Senne, Yanasse): given the job sequence, the lower bound for switches can be found with KTNS (Keep Tool Needed Soonest) algorithm (Tang, Denardo)
4. Add times to stats for finding optimal value and optimality proof
5. Dynamic MST for better upper bound
6. Channelling (sets + MIP)
7. Use lower bound algorithm (Yanasse/Senne) to a) improve lower bound, b) use initial sequence
8. Switch to CubDB or similar for result tracking/storing
9. Algo for proving upper bound for instances with small optimality gap?
